    ## The 3 States of a Property in OpenAPI

    Every field can be described using **two dimensions**:

    | Dimension                 | Meaning                                           |
    | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
    | **required (true/false)** | Whether the key **must exist** in the JSON object |
    | **nullable (true/false)** | Whether the value is allowed to be **`null`**     |

    So we get **four combinations**.

    ---

    ### 1. **Required + Not Nullable**

    ```yaml
    properties:
      data:
        type: object
    required: ["data"]
    ```

    JSON:

    ✔️ `"data": {...}`
    ❌ `"data": null`
    ❌ missing `"data"`

    This means:

    > The property MUST exist and must **not** be null.

    ---

    ### 2. **Optional + Not Nullable**

    ```yaml
    properties:
      data:
        type: object
    # not in required list
    ```

    JSON:

    ✔️ `"data": {...}`
    ✔️ omit `"data"`
    ❌ `"data": null`

    Meaning:

    > If the server includes this field, it must NOT be null.
    > But the server is allowed to drop/omit this field entirely.

    This is what you called **“un-identified”** → not required and not nullable.

    ---

    ### 3. **Required + Nullable**

    ```yaml
    properties:
      data:
        type: object
        nullable: true
    required: ["data"]
    ```

    JSON:

    ✔️ `"data": {...}`
    ✔️ `"data": null`
    ❌ missing `"data"`

    Meaning:

    > The key must be present, but value can be null.

    Rarely good design — but sometimes used when you want:

    * structural consistency
    * but the data payload may be empty

    ---

    ### 4. **Optional + Nullable**

    ```yaml
    properties:
      data:
        type: object
        nullable: true
    # not required
    ```

    JSON:

    ✔️ `"data": {...}`
    ✔️ `"data": null`
    ✔️ omit `"data"`

    Meaning:

    > Very permissive. The server can omit the field or return null.

    Often *too flexible* for reliable client code.
